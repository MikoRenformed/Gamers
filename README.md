# Gamers
We created this project as a website dedicated to the yearly E3 Gaming convention, on our site you can search for new and upcoming games
as well as get the latest news for both E3 and the gaming industry in general through announcements, articles, pictures and videos.

On the Home page you can see a brief selection of all our featured content before using the top Navigation bar to explore the other pages.

On the News page you have two sections of information, one where you can get announcements involving current and future E3 conventions and
in the second section you can see the latest gaming news articles from a constantly updating RSS feed provided by GameInformer.

On the Livestream page you can preview all the current twitch streams listed by game and sorted by highest number of current viewers,
after a 30 second preview it allows you to click on the link and continue watching the stream natively on the Twitch website.

On the Pictures page you can view all the latest pictures from the E3 convention, uploaded into an easy to use and view gallery. Similarly
on the Videos page is another gallery of videos including new game trailers and footage from the E3 panels.

On the Developers page you can access our SQL database in order to view upcoming titles. Our SQL database is capable of holding the game's
title, box art, the conference it was shown at, genre, publisher, developer, release date, metacritic score as well as plenty of additional details.
